# Affinty.propagation
This code is the C++ implementation of affinity propagation, a clustering algorithm by passing messages between data points. In this code, I cluster datasets ic which ach of the participants is represented as a data point in a 5 dimensional space.

The code is based on Cory Maklin publication about affinity propagation.

# Input
The code utilizes a 5x5 matrix as input, sourced directly from Cory Maklin's publication in Towards Data Science.
